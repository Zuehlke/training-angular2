## Example Application ##
This is a simple example application demonstration how ASP.NET Core, Angular 2, TypeScript and WebPack (to name just these four) work together.

This example application is based on the Angular template as created by the ASP.NET Core Template Pack. See [bit.ly/aspnetcoretp](http://bit.ly/aspnetcoretp) for details.
