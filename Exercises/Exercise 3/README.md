## Exercise 3 ##

In this exercise, we add the possibility to delete an exisiting expense in the overview. For that matter, we have to adapt the client (i.e. the HTML, the component and the service) as well as the backend (the Controller and the Repository).


### Tasks ###

1. Extend the HTML to add....

2. Add a method in the overview component that deletes an expense and is called when the user clicks the delete button in the browser.

3. Extend the expense-service so it can send an HTTP DELETE request to the backend in order to effectively delete an expense.

4. Implement the delete method in the `ExpenseController` and the `ExpenseRepository` on the server side.
