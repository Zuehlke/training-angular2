1. Open the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and sign in using the Microsoft ID assigned to your MSDN-subscription.
2. Open the "App Services" section, then select "Web App" and click "Create".
3. Fill in the form:
	* Provide a unique app name. Make sure to use only alphanumeric characters and dashes, as this name will be used as the URL of your application.
	* Select a Subscription. Most likely your MSDN subscription will be preselected.
	* Create a new Resource Group. Again, use only alphanumeric characters and dashes for the name.
	* Create a new App-Service plan. Yet again, use only alphanumeric characters and dashes for the name. Also make sure to select the "Free" pricing tier. You might need to click "view all" to be able to select the "Free" tier.
