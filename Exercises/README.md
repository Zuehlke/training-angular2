## Exercises ##

This folder contains the instructions and materials for the exercises used in the workshop.

- **Exercise 1** will lead you through the process of creating a module and a component together with creating the required navigation infrastructure.
- **Exercise 2** will lead you through the process of loading a set of records from the server and displaying it in the application.
- In **Exercise 3** you will extend the application to support the deletion of an expense record.
- In **Exercise 4** you will extend the application to support viewing and editing the details of an expense record.
- In **Exercise 5**, we reuse the existing form component and use it to add a new expense. For that, we also have to implement the add functionality in the backend.
- In **Exercise 6** you will write unit tests in order to test the behaviour of the application.
- In **Exercise 7** you will extend the form component to feature some basic validation.
- In **Exercise 8** we add Guards to the application navigation to prevent navigation if the user is not logged in or if there are unsaved changes.
