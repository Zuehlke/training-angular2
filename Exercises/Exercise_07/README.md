## Exercise 7: Validating Form Inputs ##

In this exercise you will extend the form component to feature some basic validation.

### Tasks ###

1. Extend the controls in the `ExpenseFormComponent` to show a validation message if the value is neither pristine nor valid.
2. Extend the controls in the `ExpenseFormComponent` to show a red border if the value is neither pristine nor valid.
3. Extend the controls in the `ExpenseFormComponent` to show a red X on the control if the value is neither pristine nor valid.

### Implementation hints ###

* Have a look at [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com) to see what can be done about the tasks!
* Have a look an [angular.io](http://angular.io) to see how to validate controls.
